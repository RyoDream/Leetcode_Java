 * 526. Beautiful Arrangement
 *
 * Suppose you have N integers from 1 to N.
 * We define a beautiful arrangement as an array
 * that is constructed by these N numbers successfully
 * if one of the following is true for the ith position (1 â‰¤ i â‰¤ N) in this array:
 *
 * The number at the ith position is divisible by i.
 * i is divisible by the number at the ith position.
 * Now given N, how many beautiful arrangements can you construct?
