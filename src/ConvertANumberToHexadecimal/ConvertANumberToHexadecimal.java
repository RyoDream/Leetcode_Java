/**
 * 405. Convert a Number to Hexadecimal
 *
 * Given an integer, write an algorithm to convert it to hexadecimal.
 * For negative integer, twoâ€™s complement method is used.
 * Note:
 *
 * 1. All letters in hexadecimal (a-f) must be in lowercase.
 *
 * 2. The hexadecimal string must not contain extra leading 0s.
 * If the number is zero, it is represented by a single zero character '0'; otherwise,
 * the first character in the hexadecimal string will not be the zero character.
 *
 * 3. The given number is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
 * 4. You must not use any method provided by the library which converts/formats the number to hex directly.
